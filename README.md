# Railway System Database
Railway System Database manages and records all the data regarding the railways. For example, train details, Routes of trains, their schedules, railway stations, customersâ€™ reservations, etc. For an easy project idea, you can take this system database and concentrate on offering similar data like the arrival and departure time of trains and the sequential number of the station.

Functionalities

The very first thing your management system should have is the Train and Schedule management, so create a database to store details of all trains like train name, its id, routes, departure and arrival time, and stops.
Now, passengers can book tickets online or at stations desk and using the management system they can reserve the ticket and for that you have to automate the updation system.
After every update, seat availability will be change and it should be provided in real time.
The system should update about the train status, like delays, and send notifications to passengers about any change in train scheduling.
The main aspect of this management system is security, so you have to implement security in your management system.
