# Railway Management Database System
The Railway Management Database System is designed to efficiently manage and record comprehensive information related to railway operations. This includes data such as train details, routes, schedules, stations, and customer reservations. A simplified version of this project can focus on key functionalities like train arrival and departure times and the sequence of station stops.

Key Functionalities:
Train & Schedule Management:
Maintain a database with details of all trains, including train names, IDs, routes, departure and arrival times, and scheduled stops.

Reservation System:
Enable passengers to book tickets either online or at station counters. The system should automatically update seat availability in real-time upon each booking or cancellation.

Real-Time Updates:
Provide real-time updates on train statuses, including delays, and send notifications to passengers about changes in scheduling.

Security Implementation:
Ensure the system is secure, with access control and data protection measures to safeguard user and operational data.
